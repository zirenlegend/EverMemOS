## Quick Start (5 Minutes)

### 1. Clone and Start Services

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/EverMind-AI/EverMemOS.git
cd EverMemOS

# Start all services with Docker
docker compose up -d

# Verify services are running
curl http://localhost:8001/health
```

### 2. Store Your First Memory

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8001/api/v1/memories" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "message_id": "msg_001",
    "create_time": "2025-01-20T10:00:00+00:00",
    "sender": "user_001",
    "content": "I love building AI applications with memory!"
  }'
```

### 3. Search Memories

```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8001/api/v1/memories/search" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "query": "What does the user love?",
    "user_id": "user_001",
    "retrieve_method": "hybrid"
  }'
```

You're ready to hack!

## Evaluation Criteria

Projects will be evaluated based on the following priorities:

### Innovation

We value creative and original approaches. Does your project solve a problem in a new way? Is the use of memory capabilities imaginative? Does it stand out from existing solutions?

### Technical Depth

We look for well-engineered projects with clean implementation, effective use of EverMemOS features, and appropriate technical sophistication for the problem being solved.

### Consumer Value

We prioritize projects that solve real problems for real users. Is it useful? Is it intuitive? Could it scale or be commercialized?

## Tips for Success

1. **Start Simple** - Get the basic flow working before adding complexity
2. **Use Hybrid Retrieval** - Best balance of speed and accuracy for most use cases
3. **Group Your Memories** - Use `group_id` for multi-user or multi-agent scenarios
4. **Check Pending Messages** - Memories may not extract immediately (boundary detection)
5. **Ask for Help** - Join our Discord for real-time support

Good luck and happy hacking!
