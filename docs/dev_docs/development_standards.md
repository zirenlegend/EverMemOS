# Development Standards

This document introduces various standards and best practices in the project development process to help the team maintain code quality and collaboration efficiency.

---

## 🚀 TL;DR (Core Principles)

### Quick Start for Newcomers (3 Steps)
```bash
uv sync --group dev-full    # Sync dependencies
pre-commit install          # Install code check hooks
```

### Core Conventions

**📦 Dependency Management**  
Use `uv add/remove` to manage dependencies, avoid direct `pip install` to maintain consistency of dependency lock files

**🎨 Code Style**  
Pre-commit checks run automatically on commit (black/ruff/isort) to keep code style consistent

**⚡️ Full Async Architecture**  
Single Event Loop, use `async/await` for I/O operations, discuss with development lead before using threads/processes

**🚫 No I/O in Loops**  
Prohibit database access and API calls in for loops, use batch operations instead

**🕐 Timezone Awareness**  
All time fields must carry timezone information. Input without timezone is treated as Shanghai timezone (Asia/Shanghai, UTC+8). Do not use `datetime.datetime.now()`, must use utility functions from `common_utils/datetime_utils.py`

**📥 Import Standards**  
- PYTHONPATH management: Project module import starting paths (src/tests/demo etc.) need unified management, communicate with development lead before changes
- Prefer absolute imports (e.g. `from core.memory import MemoryManager`), avoid relative imports (e.g. `from ...core import`)

**📝 __init__.py Standards**  
Not recommended to write any code in `__init__.py`, keep it empty

**🌿 Branch Standards**  
`dev` for daily development, `release/YYMMDD` for versioned releases, `long/xxx` for long-term feature development, `hotfix` for emergency fixes

**🔀 Unified Branch Merge Handling**  
Merging `long/xxx` to `dev`, cutting `release` from `dev`, merging `release` back to `dev` needs to be handled uniformly by development or operations lead

**📤 MR Standards**
- Keep code commits small, iterate quickly, avoid submitting too much code at once
- Each commit should be runnable, do not submit work-in-progress or broken code
- Data migration scripts, dependency changes, infrastructure code changes, merging release branches must go through Code Review

**💾 Data Migration Standards**  
For new features involving data fixes or Schema migration, discuss feasibility and implementation timing with development and operations as early as possible

**🏛️ Data Access Standards**  
All database, search engine and other external storage read/write operations must be converged to infra layer repository methods. Direct calls in business layer are prohibited

**🎯 Minimal Changes**  
Minimize code changes when implementing requirements, avoid large-scale refactoring, prioritize incremental development. Do not over-engineer, keep it simple, efficient, and maintainable

**💬 Comment Standards**  
Always add sufficient comments (function-level + step-level), ensure reviewers can quickly understand code intent

**📖 API Documentation Sync**  
When modifying API interfaces, must synchronize updates to API documentation comments, schema definition files, and auto-generated documentation files

**📄 Documentation Standards**  
Use markdown format, place in docs directory. Small issues don't need documentation, just add comments in code

## 📦 Dependency Management Standards

### Using uv for Dependency Management

**💡 Important Note: Recommended to use uv for dependency management**

The project uses `uv` as the dependency management tool. It's recommended to avoid using `pip install` directly for the following reasons:

- Dependency versions may be inconsistent
- `uv.lock` file cannot be automatically updated
- Team member environments may differ
- May affect production environment deployment

### Correct Operations

#### 1. Install/Sync Dependencies

```bash
# Sync all dependencies (first install or after updates)
uv sync --group dev-full
```

#### 2. Add New Dependencies

```bash
# Add production dependency
uv add <package-name>

# Add development dependency
uv add --dev <package-name>

# Specify version
uv add <package-name>==<version>
```

#### 3. Remove Dependencies

```bash
uv remove <package-name>
```

#### 4. Update Dependencies

```bash
# Update all dependencies
uv sync --upgrade

# Update specific dependency
uv add <package-name> --upgrade
```

## 🔧 Development Environment Configuration Standards

### Environment Configuration Description

The project depends on various databases and middleware. To ensure consistency and security of development environments, these configurations are uniformly managed and distributed by the operations team.

#### Configuration Items

Development environment typically needs the following configurations:

**Database Configuration**
- MongoDB connection information
- PostgreSQL connection information
- Redis connection information

**Middleware Configuration**
- Kafka connection configuration
- ElasticSearch connection configuration
- Other message queues or cache services

**Third-party Service Configuration**
- API keys and access credentials
- Object storage configuration
- Other external service credentials

### How to Get Configuration

#### 1. New Employee Onboarding

New developers joining the project, please follow this process to get configurations:

1. **Contact operations lead** (see contact information at the end of document)
2. **State your needs**:
   - Your name and role
   - Environment needed (development/testing)
   - Specific services to access
3. **Receive configuration**: Operations lead will provide configuration files or environment variables
4. **Local configuration**: Place configuration information in project's `config.json` or `.env` file (Note: these files are in `.gitignore`, won't be committed to repository)

#### 2. Configuration File Location

```bash
# Configuration files in project root (do not commit to git)
config.json          # Main configuration file
.env                 # Environment variable configuration
env.template         # Configuration template (reference, need to fill in real values)
```

#### 3. Environment Variable Examples

Reference `env.template` file, your `.env` file typically contains the following types of configuration:

```bash
# MongoDB
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://...
MONGODB_DATABASE=...

# Redis
REDIS_HOST=...
REDIS_PORT=...
REDIS_PASSWORD=...

# Kafka
KAFKA_BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS=...

# ElasticSearch
ES_HOST=...
ES_PORT=...
```

### Configuration Management Notes

#### ⚠️ Security Standards

1. **Prohibit committing sensitive configuration**
   - All configuration files containing passwords, keys, tokens must not be committed to git
   - Check `.gitignore` includes configuration files before committing
   - Using pre-commit hook can help detect sensitive information

2. **Configuration file permissions**
   - Local configuration files should have appropriate permissions (only current user readable)
   - Do not paste configuration content in public places (like chat records, documents)

3. **Configuration update notifications**
   - If configuration is updated, operations team will notify relevant developers
   - Update local configuration promptly after receiving notification

#### 🔄 Configuration Change Process

If you need to:
- Add new configuration items
- Modify configuration structure
- Add new environments or services

**Recommended process**:

1. **Discuss with development lead**: Confirm necessity and impact scope of configuration changes
2. **Contact operations lead**: Explain configuration needs and reasons for changes
3. **Update configuration template**: Update `env.template` and related documentation
4. **Team notification**: Notify all developers to sync update local configuration

### Different Environment Description

| Environment | Purpose | Configuration Source | Notes |
|-------------|---------|---------------------|-------|
| **Development** | Local development and debugging | Provided by operations | Usually connects to development database, data can be freely tested |
| **Testing** | Integration and functional testing | Auto-deployed configuration | Connects to test database, data periodically reset |
| **Production** | Live running services | Strictly controlled by operations | Only operations and authorized personnel can access |

**Note**: Developers usually only need development environment configuration. Testing and production environment configurations are managed by CI/CD and operations team.

## 🎨 Code Style Standards

### Pre-commit Hook Configuration

The project uses `pre-commit` to unify code style. It's recommended to install pre-commit hook after first cloning the project.

#### Installation Steps

```bash
# 1. Ensure development dependencies are synced
uv sync --dev

# 2. Install pre-commit hook
pre-commit install
```

#### Functions

Pre-commit hook will automatically execute the following checks before each commit:

- **Code formatting**: Format Python code using black/ruff
- **Import sorting**: Sort import statements using isort
- **Code checking**: Code quality check using ruff/flake8
- **Type checking**: Type check using pyright/mypy
- **YAML/JSON format**: Check configuration file format
- **Trailing whitespace**: Remove extra whitespace at end of files

#### Manual Check

```bash
# Run check on all files
pre-commit run --all-files

# Run check on staged files
pre-commit run
```

---

## 💬 Comment Standards

### Core Principle

**💡 Important Note: Always add sufficient comments**

Good comments help team members quickly understand code intent, improving maintainability and Code Review efficiency.

### Comment Requirements

#### 1. Function-level Comments (Google-style Docstring)

Every function/method should have a clear **Google-style docstring** explaining:

- **Description**: What the function does
- **Args**: Type and purpose of each parameter
- **Returns**: Return value type and meaning
- **Raises**: Exceptions that may be thrown (if applicable)

```python
# ✅ Recommended: Complete function-level comments
async def fetch_user_memories(
    user_id: str,
    limit: int = 100,
    include_archived: bool = False
) -> list[Memory]:
    """
    Fetch user's memory list.
    
    Args:
        user_id: User unique identifier
        limit: Maximum number of memories to return, default 100
        include_archived: Whether to include archived memories, default False
    
    Returns:
        User's memory list, sorted by creation time in descending order
    
    Raises:
        UserNotFoundError: When user does not exist
    """
    ...
```

#### 2. Step-level Comments

In complex business logic, add comments at key steps to explain the purpose of each step:

```python
# ✅ Recommended: Add comments at key steps
async def process_memory_extraction(raw_data: dict) -> Memory:
    # 1. Validate input data integrity
    validated_data = validate_input(raw_data)
    
    # 2. Extract key information (people, events, time, etc.)
    extracted_info = await extract_key_information(validated_data)
    
    # 3. Generate vector embedding for subsequent retrieval
    embedding = await generate_embedding(extracted_info.content)
    
    # 4. Build memory object and persist
    memory = Memory(
        content=extracted_info.content,
        embedding=embedding,
        metadata=extracted_info.metadata
    )
    
    return memory
```

#### 3. Complex Logic Explanation

For complex algorithms, business rules, or non-intuitive code, add detailed explanations:

```python
# ✅ Recommended: Explain complex business rules
def calculate_memory_score(memory: Memory, query: str) -> float:
    """Calculate relevance score between memory and query"""
    # Base similarity score (cosine similarity)
    base_score = cosine_similarity(memory.embedding, query_embedding)
    
    # Time decay factor: newer memories have higher weight
    # Using exponential decay with half-life of 30 days
    days_old = (now - memory.created_at).days
    time_decay = math.exp(-0.693 * days_old / 30)
    
    # Importance weighting: memories marked as important get 50% boost
    importance_boost = 1.5 if memory.is_important else 1.0
    
    return base_score * time_decay * importance_boost
```

### Comment Style

- Use Chinese or English consistently within the same project/module
- Comments should be concise and clear, avoid redundancy
- Keep comments updated when code changes
- Don't comment obvious code

```python
# ❌ Not recommended: Redundant comment
i = i + 1  # increment i by 1

# ✅ Recommended: Explain "why" not "what"
i = i + 1  # Skip header row, start processing from data rows
```

### Checklist

Before submitting code, confirm:

- [ ] All public functions/methods have docstrings
- [ ] Complex business logic has step-level comments
- [ ] Non-intuitive code has explanatory comments
- [ ] Comments are in sync with code, no outdated comments
- [ ] Reviewers can quickly understand code intent

## 📖 API Specification Sync

### Core Principle

**💡 Important Note: Must synchronize API documentation when modifying API interfaces**

API documentation is the key basis for frontend-backend collaboration and service integration. Inconsistency between documentation and actual API leads to integration issues and debugging difficulties.

### Sync Requirements

When modifying API interfaces, must complete the following sync operations:

#### 1. Update API Documentation Comments

Ensure code API documentation comments match actual behavior:

```python
# ✅ Recommended: Keep documentation comments consistent with actual API
from fastapi import APIRouter, Query

router = APIRouter()

@router.get("/memories/{memory_id}")
async def get_memory(
    memory_id: str,
    include_embedding: bool = Query(False, description="Whether to return vector embedding")
) -> MemoryResponse:
    """
    Get detailed information of specified memory.
    
    - **memory_id**: Memory unique identifier
    - **include_embedding**: Whether to include vector embedding data in response
    
    Returns:
        MemoryResponse: Memory details including content, metadata, etc.
    
    Raises:
        404: Memory not found
        403: No permission to access this memory
    """
    ...
```

#### 2. Update Schema Definition Files

If API request/response structure changes, update related schema definitions:

```python
# Update Pydantic model
class MemoryResponse(BaseModel):
    """Memory response model"""
    id: str = Field(..., description="Memory unique identifier")
    content: str = Field(..., description="Memory content")
    created_at: datetime = Field(..., description="Creation time")
    # When adding new fields, add clear descriptions
    embedding: list[float] | None = Field(None, description="Vector embedding, only returned on request")
```

#### 3. Regenerate API Documentation Files

If the project uses auto-generated API documentation (e.g., OpenAPI/Swagger), ensure regeneration:

```bash
# Example: Regenerate OpenAPI documentation
python scripts/generate_openapi.py

# Or ensure FastAPI auto-generated docs are up to date
# Visit /docs or /redoc to verify
```

#### 4. Notify Stakeholders

If it's a major API change, notify frontend and other dependent service developers.

### Checklist

Before submitting API changes, confirm:

- [ ] API documentation comments updated and consistent with actual behavior
- [ ] Schema definition files (Pydantic models, etc.) updated
- [ ] Auto-generated API documentation files regenerated
- [ ] Frontend and other services can develop based on latest API specification
- [ ] If breaking changes, stakeholders have been notified

## 📄 Documentation Standards

### Core Principle

**💡 Important Note: Do not over-generate documentation**

Documentation is an important supplement to code, but excessive documentation increases maintenance burden. Follow the "necessary and sufficient" principle.

### When Documentation is Needed

| Scenario | Need Documentation | Notes |
|----------|-------------------|-------|
| Small bug fix | ❌ No | Just explain in code comments |
| Small feature optimization | ❌ No | Explain in commit message and code comments |
| New API endpoint | ⚠️ Depends | API doc comments required, separate doc depends on complexity |
| New module/component | ✅ Yes | Write module introduction documentation |
| Large-scale refactoring | ✅ Yes | Document reasons, approach and impact |
| Architecture design changes | ✅ Yes | Document design decisions and architecture description |
| Complex business processes | ✅ Yes | Write process documentation |

### Documentation Format Requirements

- **Format**: Use Markdown (`.md`) format
- **Syntax**: Follow standard Markdown syntax

### Documentation Location

```
project_root/
├── docs/                        # Documentation root
│   ├── api_docs/               # API documentation
│   │   └── memory_api.md
│   ├── dev_docs/               # Development documentation
│   │   └── development_standards.md
│   ├── architecture/           # Architecture documentation
│   │   └── system_design.md
│   └── guides/                 # User guides
│       └── getting_started.md
```

### Naming Convention

- **Format**: `{category}/{filename}.md`
- **Examples**:
  - `api_docs/document_slice_api.md`
  - `dev_docs/coding_standards.md`
  - `architecture/memory_system_design.md`

### Documentation Content Suggestions

A good document typically contains:

1. **Title and introduction**: Explain the purpose of the document
2. **Background/motivation**: Why this feature/change is needed
3. **Core content**: Detailed explanation
4. **Examples**: Code examples or usage examples
5. **Related documentation**: Links to other related documents

### Checklist

Before writing documentation, ask yourself:

- [ ] Is this change complex enough to need separate documentation?
- [ ] Are code comments already sufficient to explain the issue?
- [ ] Is the documentation in the correct directory?
- [ ] Is the documentation name clear and understandable?

---

## ⚡️ Async Programming Standards

### Full Async Architecture Principles

The project adopts **full async architecture**, based on the following principles:

#### 1. Single Event Loop Principle

- **The entire application uses one main Event Loop**
- Avoid creating new Event Loops in code (`asyncio.new_event_loop()`)
- Avoid using `asyncio.run()` to start new loops in async context

#### 2. About Using Threads and Processes ⚠️

**💡 Important Note: Be cautious with multithreading and multiprocessing**

The project is based on single Event Loop full async architecture, avoid the following operations:

```python
# ❌ Not recommended: Creating threads
import threading
thread = threading.Thread(target=some_function)
thread.start()

# ❌ Not recommended: Using thread pool (unless special cases)
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor
executor = ThreadPoolExecutor()

# ❌ Not recommended: Creating processes
import multiprocessing
process = multiprocessing.Process(target=some_function)
process.start()

# ❌ Not recommended: Using process pool
from concurrent.futures import ProcessPoolExecutor
executor = ProcessPoolExecutor()
```

**Why not recommended?**
- May break single Event Loop architecture, causing concurrency issues
- Thread safety issues are complex, easy to introduce race conditions
- Resource management is difficult, may cause resource leaks
- May affect async context (contextvars) normal operation
- Debugging becomes harder, stack traces are complex

**Special Case Handling**

If you really need to use threads or processes (e.g., CPU-intensive computation, calling third-party libraries that don't support async), it's recommended to:

1. **Discuss with development lead in advance**
2. Explain why async solution cannot meet the needs
3. Provide resource management plan (ensure threads/processes are properly closed)
4. Go through Code Review

**Allowed scenario examples**:

```python
# ✅ Special case: Calling sync libraries that don't support async (after discussion)
import asyncio
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor

# Globally shared thread pool, limit max threads
_EXECUTOR = ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=4)

async def call_sync_library(data):
    """Call third-party library that doesn't support async (confirmed with lead)"""
    loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
    # Run in thread pool to avoid blocking main loop
    result = await loop.run_in_executor(
        _EXECUTOR,
        sync_blocking_function,
        data
    )
    return result
```

#### 3. Async Function Definition

I/O operations should use async functions:

```python
# ✅ Correct: Async function
async def fetch_user_data(user_id: str) -> dict:
    async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
        response = await client.get(f"/users/{user_id}")
        return response.json()

# ❌ Wrong: Sync I/O
def fetch_user_data(user_id: str) -> dict:
    response = requests.get(f"/users/{user_id}")
    return response.json()
```

#### 4. Database Operations

```python
# ✅ Correct: Using async database driver
from pymongo import AsyncMongoClient

async def get_user(db, user_id: str):
    return await db.users.find_one({"_id": user_id})

# ❌ Wrong: Using sync driver
from pymongo import MongoClient

def get_user(db, user_id: str):
    return db.users.find_one({"_id": user_id})
```

#### 5. HTTP Client

```python
# ✅ Correct: Using httpx.AsyncClient
import httpx

async def call_api(url: str):
    async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
        response = await client.get(url)
        return response.json()

# ❌ Wrong: Using requests
import requests

def call_api(url: str):
    response = requests.get(url)
    return response.json()
```

#### 6. Concurrent Processing

Use `asyncio.gather()` for concurrent operations:

```python
# ✅ Correct: Execute multiple tasks concurrently
async def fetch_multiple_users(user_ids: list[str]):
    tasks = [fetch_user_data(uid) for uid in user_ids]
    results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
    return results

# ❌ Wrong: Serial execution
async def fetch_multiple_users(user_ids: list[str]):
    results = []
    for uid in user_ids:
        result = await fetch_user_data(uid)
        results.append(result)
    return results
```

#### 7. Prohibit I/O Operations in for Loops ⚠️

**💡 Important Note: Avoid serial I/O operations in loops**

Doing database access, API calls and other I/O operations in for loops causes serious performance issues, because each operation needs to wait for the previous one to complete, unable to take advantage of async concurrency.

**❌ Wrong example: I/O operations in loops**

```python
# Wrong: Serial database access in loop
async def get_users_info(user_ids: list[str]):
    results = []
    for user_id in user_ids:
        # Each loop iteration waits for database return, very poor performance
        user = await db.users.find_one({"_id": user_id})
        results.append(user)
    return results

# Wrong: Serial API calls in loop
async def fetch_user_profiles(user_ids: list[str]):
    profiles = []
    for user_id in user_ids:
        # Each loop iteration waits for API response, wasting time
        response = await api_client.get(f"/users/{user_id}")
        profiles.append(response.json())
    return profiles

# Wrong: Batch database inserts in loop
async def save_messages(messages: list[dict]):
    for msg in messages:
        # Each message inserted separately, very inefficient
        await db.messages.insert_one(msg)
```

**✅ Correct example: Using concurrent or batch operations**

```python
# Correct: Using asyncio.gather for concurrent execution
async def get_users_info(user_ids: list[str]):
    tasks = [db.users.find_one({"_id": uid}) for uid in user_ids]
    results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
    return results

# Correct: Using asyncio.gather for concurrent API calls
async def fetch_user_profiles(user_ids: list[str]):
    tasks = [api_client.get(f"/users/{uid}") for uid in user_ids]
    responses = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
    return [r.json() for r in responses]

# Correct: Using batch insert operation
async def save_messages(messages: list[dict]):
    if messages:
        await db.messages.insert_many(messages)

# Correct: Using database's in query instead of loop query
async def get_users_info(user_ids: list[str]):
    # Single query to get all data
    cursor = db.users.find({"_id": {"$in": user_ids}})
    results = await cursor.to_list(length=None)
    return results
```

**Performance Comparison**

Assuming 100 users, each database query takes 10ms:
- ❌ Loop serial query: 100 × 10ms = 1000ms (1 second)
- ✅ Concurrent query: ~10ms (almost simultaneous completion)
- ✅ Batch query: ~10ms (single query)

**Exception Cases**

In rare cases you may need to do I/O in loops, but must meet the following conditions:

1. **Subsequent operations depend on previous result**: Must wait for previous operation to complete before next one
2. **Rate limiting needs**: Need to control concurrency to avoid pressure on external services
3. **Approved by development lead**

```python
# Allowed: Serial operations with dependencies (comment explaining reason)
async def process_workflow(steps: list[dict]):
    result = None
    for step in steps:
        # Each step depends on previous step's result, cannot be concurrent
        result = await execute_step(step, previous_result=result)
    return result

# Allowed: Using semaphore to control concurrency (comment explaining reason)
async def fetch_with_rate_limit(urls: list[str]):
    # Limit max 5 concurrent requests to avoid triggering external API rate limiting
    semaphore = asyncio.Semaphore(5)
    
    async def fetch_one(url: str):
        async with semaphore:
            return await api_client.get(url)
    
    tasks = [fetch_one(url) for url in urls]
    return await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
```

## 🕐 Timezone Awareness Standards

### Core Principle

**💡 Important Note: All time fields must be timezone-aware**

When handling date and time data, must ensure all time fields carry timezone information to avoid data errors and business issues caused by unclear timezone.

**⚠️ Prohibit direct use of `datetime` module standard methods**

The project uniformly uses utility functions from `common_utils/datetime_utils.py` for time handling, prohibit direct use of:
- ❌ `datetime.datetime.now()`
- ❌ `datetime.datetime.utcnow()`
- ❌ `datetime.datetime.today()`

Must use project-provided utility functions:
- ✅ `get_now_with_timezone()` - Get current time (with timezone)
- ✅ `from_timestamp()` - Convert from timestamp
- ✅ `from_iso_format()` - Convert from ISO format string
- ✅ `to_iso_format()` - Convert to ISO format string
- ✅ `to_timestamp()` / `to_timestamp_ms()` - Convert to timestamp

### Timezone Handling Rules

#### 1. Input Data Timezone Requirements

All time fields entering the system must meet:

- **Must carry timezone info**: All datetime type fields must be timezone-aware
- **Default timezone**: If input data doesn't have timezone info, treat it as **Asia/Shanghai (Shanghai timezone, UTC+8)**
- **Storage format**: When storing in database, recommend converting to UTC timezone uniformly, but must preserve timezone info

#### 2. Python Implementation Standards

**✅ Correct example: Using project utility functions**

```python
from common_utils.datetime_utils import (
    get_now_with_timezone,
    from_timestamp,
    from_iso_format,
    to_iso_format,
    to_timestamp_ms,
    to_timezone
)

# Method 1: Get current time (automatically with Shanghai timezone)
now = get_now_with_timezone()
# Returns: datetime.datetime(2025, 9, 16, 20, 17, 41, tzinfo=zoneinfo.ZoneInfo(key='Asia/Shanghai'))

# Method 2: Convert from timestamp (auto-detect seconds/milliseconds, auto-add timezone)
dt = from_timestamp(1758025061)
dt_ms = from_timestamp(1758025061000)

# Method 3: Convert from ISO string (auto-handle timezone)
dt = from_iso_format("2025-09-15T13:11:15.588000")  # No timezone, auto-add Shanghai timezone
dt_with_tz = from_iso_format("2025-09-15T13:11:15+08:00")  # Has timezone, preserve original then convert

# Method 4: Format to ISO string (auto-include timezone)
iso_str = to_iso_format(now)
# Returns: "2025-09-16T20:20:06.517301+08:00"

# Method 5: Convert to timestamp
ts = to_timestamp_ms(now)
# Returns: 1758025061123
```

**❌ Wrong example: Direct use of datetime module**

```python
import datetime

# ❌ Wrong: Prohibit using datetime.datetime.now()
naive_dt = datetime.datetime.now()  # Timezone unclear, prohibit!

# ❌ Wrong: Prohibit using datetime.datetime.utcnow()
dt = datetime.datetime.utcnow()  # Deprecated in Python 3.12+, prohibit!

# ❌ Wrong: Prohibit using datetime.datetime.today()
dt = datetime.datetime.today()  # Timezone unclear, prohibit!

# ❌ Wrong: Manually creating naive datetime
naive_dt = datetime.datetime(2025, 1, 1, 12, 0, 0)  # No timezone info
```

**🔧 How to fix existing code**

```python
# Old code (wrong)
import datetime
now = datetime.datetime.now()

# New code (correct)
from common_utils.datetime_utils import get_now_with_timezone
now = get_now_with_timezone()

# ----------------

# Old code (wrong)
from datetime import datetime
dt = datetime(2025, 1, 1, 12, 0, 0)

# New code (correct)
from common_utils.datetime_utils import from_iso_format
dt = from_iso_format("2025-01-01T12:00:00")  # Auto-add Shanghai timezone

# ----------------

# Old code (wrong)
ts = int(datetime.now().timestamp() * 1000)

# New code (correct)
from common_utils.datetime_utils import get_now_with_timezone, to_timestamp_ms
ts = to_timestamp_ms(get_now_with_timezone())
```

### Checklist

During code review, please confirm:

- [ ] **Prohibit direct use of `datetime.datetime.now()`**, must use `get_now_with_timezone()`
- [ ] **Prohibit direct use of `datetime.datetime.utcnow()`** or `datetime.datetime.today()`
- [ ] All time retrieval goes through utility functions in `common_utils/datetime_utils.py`
- [ ] Time parsed from external input uses `from_iso_format()` or `from_timestamp()`
- [ ] Time formatting uses `to_iso_format()` instead of manually calling `.isoformat()`
- [ ] Timestamp conversion uses `to_timestamp_ms()` instead of manual calculation
- [ ] Database schema uses timezone-aware types (e.g., `timestamptz`)
- [ ] API response time strings include timezone info (ISO 8601 format)
- [ ] Test data in unit tests all have timezone info

## 🏛️ Data Access Standards

### Core Principle

**💡 Important Note: All external storage access must go through infra layer repository**

When handling databases, search engines and other external storage systems, must follow strict layered architecture principles. All data read/write operations must be converged to `infra_layer` `repository` layer, prohibit direct calls to external storage capabilities in business layer or other upper layers.

**⚠️ Prohibit direct external storage access in these layers**
- ❌ `biz_layer` (Business layer)
- ❌ `memory_layer` (Memory layer)
- ❌ `agentic_layer` (Agent layer)
- ❌ API interface layer (`api_specs`)
- ❌ Application layer (`app.py`, controllers, etc.)

**✅ Must access through**
- `infra_layer/adapters/out/persistence/repository/` - Database access
- `infra_layer/adapters/out/search/repository/` - Search engine access

### Why This Standard?

#### 1. Separation of Concerns

Following Hexagonal Architecture and Clean Architecture principles:
- **Business layer**: Focus on business logic, don't care where data comes from
- **Infrastructure layer**: Handle all external system interaction details
- **Isolate changes**: When changing database or search engine, only need to modify infra layer

#### 2. Testability

```python
# ✅ Benefit: Business layer depends on abstract interface, easy to mock test
async def process_user_memory(user_id: str, memory_repo: MemoryRepository):
    """Business logic doesn't depend on specific implementation"""
    memories = await memory_repo.find_by_user_id(user_id)
    # Business processing...
    
# Can easily replace with mock during testing
mock_repo = MockMemoryRepository()
await process_user_memory("user_1", mock_repo)
```

#### 3. Code Reuse and Consistency

- Avoid repeatedly writing same database query logic in multiple places
- Unified exception handling, logging, performance monitoring
- Unified data transformation, validation

#### 4. Centralized Performance Optimization

- Index optimization, query optimization implemented uniformly in repository layer
- Cache strategies managed uniformly
- Batch operation optimization done in one place, benefits entire project

### Correct Architecture Layering

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  API Layer (api_specs, app.py)         │
│  - Receive requests, return responses   │
└─────────────┬───────────────────────────┘
              │ calls
              ▼
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Business Layer (biz_layer)             │
│  - Business logic processing            │

└─────────────┬───────────────────────────┘
              │ dependency injection
              ▼
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐

│  - Memory management logic              │
│  - Depends on abstract interfaces (Port)│
└─────────────┬───────────────────────────┘
              │ dependency injection
              ▼
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Infrastructure Layer (infra_layer)     │
│  - Repository implementation (Adapter)  │
│  - Directly operate database/search     │
│  - MongoDB, PostgreSQL, ES, Milvus      │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Checklist

When writing or reviewing code, please confirm:

- [ ] **Are database operations in infra_layer/repository?**
- [ ] **Are search engine operations in infra_layer/repository?**
- [ ] **Does business layer depend on abstract interfaces (Port) not concrete implementations?**
- [ ] **Is dependency injection used to pass repository?**
- [ ] **Avoid directly creating database connections in business/API/application layers?**
- [ ] **Avoid directly using MongoDB/PostgreSQL/ES/Milvus clients in business layer?**
- [ ] **Has new Repository been registered in dependency injection container?**
- [ ] **Do Repository methods have clear business semantics (not exposing underlying implementation details)?**

## 📥 Import Standards

### PYTHONPATH Management

**💡 Important Note: PYTHONPATH needs unified management**

The project uniformly manages `PYTHONPATH` and module import paths. Changes involving path configuration should be discussed with development lead before unified configuration.

#### Why Unified Management?

- Chaotic import paths may cause modules not found or import errors
- Inconsistent paths across environments (dev/test/prod) may cause deployment issues
- Inconsistent IDE configuration may affect team collaboration
- Mixing relative and absolute imports increases code maintenance difficulty

#### Management Scope

The following directories in the project should maintain unified import paths:

- `src/`: Main business code
- `tests/`: Test code
- `unit_test/`: Unit tests
- `evaluation/`: Evaluation scripts
- Other directories needing to be imported (e.g., `demo/`)

#### Recommended Practices

1. **Unified project root directory**
   - Project root is `/Users/admin/memsys` (or corresponding deployment path)
   - src directory added to PYTHONPATH, import directly from module name

2. **Import standard examples**

```python
# ✅ Recommended: Absolute import (src already in PYTHONPATH)
from core.memory.manager import MemoryManager
from infra_layer.adapters.out.db import MongoDBAdapter
from tests.fixtures.mock_data import get_mock_user

# ✅ Recommended: Import in test files
from unit_test.email_data_constructor import construct_email

# ❌ Not recommended: Cross-level relative import
from ...core.memory.manager import MemoryManager

# ❌ Not recommended: Including src prefix (src already in PYTHONPATH, no prefix needed)
from src.core.memory.manager import MemoryManager

# ❌ Not recommended: Using sys.path.append to temporarily modify path
import sys
sys.path.append("../src")  # May cause environment inconsistency
```

### Prefer Absolute Imports

**💡 Important Note: Recommend absolute imports, avoid relative imports**

#### Why Recommend Absolute Imports?

Although relative imports are more concise in some scenarios, they have these issues:

- **Poor readability**: `from ...core.memory import Manager` is less intuitive than `from core.memory import Manager`
- **Difficult refactoring**: Moving files requires modifying all relative import levels
- **Complex debugging**: Stack traces with relative import paths are unclear
- **Tool support**: IDE and static analysis tools support absolute imports better
- **Testing convenience**: Test files using absolute imports are easier to understand dependencies

#### Import Style Comparison

```python
# ✅ Recommended: Absolute import (src already in PYTHONPATH)
from core.memory.manager import MemoryManager
from core.memory.types import MemoryType, MemoryStatus
from infra_layer.adapters.out.db.mongodb import MongoDBAdapter
from common_utils.logger import get_logger

# ✅ Acceptable: Single-level relative import within same package
# File: src/core/memory/manager.py
from .types import MemoryType  # Same directory
from .extractors.base import BaseExtractor  # Subdirectory

# ❌ Not recommended: Cross-level relative import
from ...infra_layer.adapters import MongoDBAdapter
from ....common_utils.logger import get_logger

# ❌ Not recommended: Multi-level upward relative import (hard to maintain)
from ......some_module import something
```

### __init__.py Usage Standards

**💡 Important Note: Not recommended to write any code in `__init__.py`**

#### Why Keep `__init__.py` Empty?

- **Import side effects**: `__init__.py` executes when package is imported, any code may produce unexpected side effects
- **Circular dependencies**: Even simple module exports easily cause circular import issues
- **Performance impact**: Code execution during import affects startup performance and module loading speed
- **Maintainability**: Code scattered in `__init__.py` is hard to locate and maintain
- **Testing difficulty**: Mock and unit tests become complex
- **Implicit behavior**: Implicit execution during import increases code understanding difficulty

#### Recommended Usage

**✅ Recommended: Keep as empty file**

```python
# src/core/memory/__init__.py

# Empty file, only serves as Python package identifier
# Do not write any code here
```

**How to import modules?**

Import directly from specific module files, don't rely on `__init__.py` re-export:

```python
# ✅ Recommended: Import directly from module files
from core.memory.manager import MemoryManager
from core.memory.types import MemoryType, MemoryStatus
from core.memory.extractors.base import BaseExtractor

# ❌ Not recommended: Relying on __init__.py re-export
from core.memory import MemoryManager  # Requires export code in __init__.py
```

#### Checklist

When writing or reviewing `__init__.py`, please confirm:

- [ ] File is empty (or only contains comments)?
- [ ] No import statements?
- [ ] No variable or constant definitions?
- [ ] No global object instances created?
- [ ] No classes or functions defined?
- [ ] No logic executed?

**If any of the above answers "no", move the code to a separate module file.**

## 📁 Module Introduction File Naming

### Core Principle

**💡 Important Note: Use `introduction.md` as module introduction file**

In subdirectories under `src/core/`, uniformly use lowercase `introduction.md` as module introduction file, not uppercase `README.md`.

### Why Not Use README.md?

- `README.md` may be auto-generated or legacy files
- Using `introduction.md` clearly distinguishes manually written module introductions from auto-generated content
- Maintains naming consistency and predictability

### Naming Examples

```
src/core/
├── di/
│   └── introduction.md              # DI module introduction
├── addons/
│   └── introduction.md              # Addons module introduction
├── component/
│   └── introduction.md              # Component module introduction
└── memory/
    └── introduction.md              # Memory module introduction
```

### introduction.md Content Suggestions

A good module introduction file should include:

1. **Module overview**: Module functionality and positioning
2. **Directory structure**: File organization within the module
3. **Core features**: Main classes, functions, and interface descriptions
4. **Usage examples**: Basic usage code examples
5. **Related documentation**: Links to other related documents

---

## 🌿 Branch Management Standards

### Branch Type Descriptions

| Branch | Description | Notes |
|--------|-------------|-------|
| `master` | Stable version; only bug fix branches cut from here, `release/xxx` and `hotfix/xxx` merge here | Production deployment branch |
| `dev` | Daily development version; continuous code commits | If versioning has started & commit is for this version, commit to `release`; non-urgent small bugs & features merge to `dev`, catch next release |
| `release/YYMMDD` | Versioning branch; first deploy to test, then production; first merge `dev` to `master`, then cut from `dev`; after actual release merge back to `master`, `dev` | Currently irregular (notified in group); only this release's bug or code commits |
| `feature/xxxx` | Single cycle, small feature; merge to `dev` or some `release` | Merge to `dev` can be direct; merge to `release` recommend MR |
| `bugfix/xxxx` | Single cycle, small bug; merge to `dev` or some `release` | Merge to `dev` can be direct; merge to `release` recommend MR |
| `long/xxx` | Cross-cycle, large feature; cut from `dev`, merge to `dev` or some `release` | Separate test in new test environment (port/address distinction); regularly merge `dev` to avoid too many conflicts at end; recommend MR |
| `hotfix/xxxx` | Bug fix; cut from `master`, MR to `master` branch (`dev` if needed) | Only exists after release; normal dev stage bugs merge directly on `dev`, during versioning but before release merge to `release`, urgent bugs without current versioning use this branch; recommend MR |

### Environment and Branch Mapping

| Environment | Possible Branches | Notes |
|-------------|------------------|-------|
| Production | `master` branch | Stable version |
|            | `release/xxx` branch | After versioned release and before bug fix |
| Testing | `dev` branch | Daily development stage |
|         | `release/xxx` branch | Versioning test stage |
|         | `hotfix/xxxx` | Emergency bug fix |

### Version Tag Standards

| Tag | Description | Notes |
|-----|-------------|-------|
| `X.Y.Z` | Version number: Major.Iteration.BugFix | May not sync with iterations, add when needed |

- **X (Major version)**: Major architecture changes or incompatible updates
- **Y (Iteration version)**: Feature iterations, new features added
- **Z (Fix version)**: Bug fixes, small optimizations

### Branch Operation Flows

#### 1. Daily Development (feature/bugfix)

```bash
# Create feature branch from dev
git checkout dev
git pull origin dev
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# After development complete
git add .
git commit -m "feat: your feature description"
git push origin feature/your-feature-name

# Merge to dev (small features can merge directly)
git checkout dev
git merge feature/your-feature-name
git push origin dev

# Delete feature branch
git branch -d feature/your-feature-name
git push origin --delete feature/your-feature-name
```

#### 2. Release Flow (release)

```bash
# 1. First merge dev to master (ensure includes latest hotfix)
git checkout dev
git pull origin dev
git merge master
git push origin dev

# 2. Create release branch from dev
git checkout -b release/$(date +%y%m%d)
git push origin release/$(date +%y%m%d)

# 3. Bug fixes during testing stage
git checkout release/$(date +%y%m%d)
# ... fix bugs ...
git commit -m "fix: bug description"
git push origin release/$(date +%y%m%d)

# 4. After release merge back to master and dev
git checkout master
git merge release/$(date +%y%m%d)
git tag -a v1.2.3 -m "Release version 1.2.3"
git push origin master --tags

git checkout dev
git merge release/$(date +%y%m%d)
git push origin dev
```

#### 3. Emergency Fix (hotfix)

```bash
# Create hotfix branch from master
git checkout master
git pull origin master
git checkout -b hotfix/critical-bug-fix

# After fix complete, recommend MR process
git add .
git commit -m "hotfix: critical bug description"
git push origin hotfix/critical-bug-fix

# Create Merge Request to master
# After merge remember to sync to dev
git checkout dev
git merge master
git push origin dev
```

#### 4. Long-term Feature Development (long)

```bash
# Create long branch from dev
git checkout dev
git pull origin dev
git checkout -b long/big-feature

# Regularly merge dev to avoid conflict accumulation
git checkout long/big-feature
git merge dev

# After feature complete, recommend MR process to merge to dev or release
```

### Unified Branch Merge Handling Standards

**⚠️ Important Note: The following branch merge operations need to be handled uniformly by development or operations lead**

To ensure code quality and release process standards, the following branch merge operations need to be managed and executed uniformly by development lead or operations lead:

#### Merge Operations Needing Unified Handling

1. **Long-term feature branch merge to dev**
   - `long/xxx` → `dev`
   - Reason: Long-term feature branches usually involve large code changes, need to evaluate impact scope and potential conflicts

2. **Cut release branch from dev**
   - `dev` → `release/YYMMDD`
   - Reason: Release nodes need unified coordination, ensure version content is complete and meets release requirements

3. **Merge release back to dev**
   - `release/YYMMDD` → `dev`
   - Reason: Ensure release branch bug fixes correctly sync back to main development branch

#### Notes

- Small feature branches (`feature/xxx`, `bugfix/xxx`) merging to `dev` can be done by developers
- Emergency `hotfix` merging to `master` recommend MR process with lead review
- All merges involving `release` and `master` recommend lead confirmation

---

## 📤 MR Standards

### Core Principles

#### 1. Small Steps, Reduce Single Commit Size

**💡 Important Note: Keep code commits small, iterate quickly, avoid submitting too much code at once**

Each MR should stay small and focused, easy to review and track issues.

**Why small steps?**

- **Easy to Review**: Smaller changes are easier to understand and review, higher Review quality
- **Fast feedback**: Small batch commits get feedback faster, adjust direction in time
- **Issue location**: When problems occur, easier to locate specific commit
- **Lower risk**: Risk of merging large amounts of code at once is much higher than multiple small merges
- **Reduce conflicts**: Frequent small batch merges reduce code conflict probability and complexity

**Recommended practices**:

```bash
# ✅ Recommended: Split commits by feature points or logical units
git commit -m "feat: add user authentication endpoint"
git commit -m "feat: add user authentication middleware"
git commit -m "test: add user authentication unit tests"

# ❌ Not recommended: Submit large amounts of unrelated changes at once
git commit -m "feat: complete all user module features"  # Contains dozens of file changes
```

**Commit split suggestions**:

| Commit Type | Recommended Size | Description |
|-------------|-----------------|-------------|
| **Feature development** | 50-200 lines | One independent feature point or logical unit |
| **Bug fix** | As small as possible | Only include code necessary for fix |
| **Refactoring** | 100-300 lines | Only one type of refactoring at a time |
| **Documentation** | Flexible | Documentation updates can be relatively flexible |

#### 2. Ensure Each Commit is Runnable

**💡 Important Note: Try not to submit broken or work-in-progress code, each commit should be runnable**

Each commit to shared branches (like `dev`, `release`) should be a runnable complete state.

**Why ensure commit quality?**

- **Continuous integration**: Ensure CI/CD pipeline won't fail due to incomplete code
- **Team collaboration**: Other developers can run and develop normally after pulling code
- **Fast rollback**: Any commit is a stable point that can be safely rolled back to
- **Code tracing**: Tools like `git bisect` need each commit to be runnable

**Pre-commit checklist**:

- [ ] Code passes pre-commit checks (formatting, lint, etc.)
- [ ] No obvious syntax or runtime errors
- [ ] Related unit tests pass
- [ ] Feature is complete, not half-finished
- [ ] No debug code (like `print` debug statements, commented out code blocks)
- [ ] No sensitive information (passwords, keys, tokens, etc.)

#### 3. Files Requiring Code Review

**💡 Important Note: The following types of file changes must go through Code Review**

To ensure code quality and system stability, changes to the following files or directories must create MR and assign reviewers:

##### Data-related Files

| File/Directory | Description | Risk Level |
|----------------|-------------|------------|
| `migrations/` | Database migration scripts | 🔴 High |
| `devops_scripts/data_fix/` | Data fix scripts | 🔴 High |
| Any batch scripts involving `insert`/`update`/`delete` | Batch data changes | 🔴 High |

##### Dependency-related Files

| File/Directory | Description | Risk Level |
|----------------|-------------|------------|
| `pyproject.toml` | Dependency configuration changes | 🟠 Medium-High |
| `uv.lock` | Dependency lock file changes | 🟠 Medium-High |

##### Infrastructure-related Files

| File/Directory | Description | Risk Level |
|----------------|-------------|------------|
| `infra_layer/` | Infrastructure layer code | 🟠 Medium-High |
| `bootstrap.py` | Application startup entry | 🔴 High |
| `application_startup.py` | Application startup flow | 🔴 High |
| `base_app.py` | Base application class | 🔴 High |
| Dependency injection container config | DI container configuration | 🟠 Medium-High |

##### Branch Merge Operations

| Operation Type | Description | Risk Level |
|----------------|-------------|------------|
| Merge to `release/xxx` | Release branch merge | 🟠 Medium-High |
| Merge to `master` | Main branch merge | 🔴 High |
| `long/xxx` → `dev` | Long-term branch merge | 🟠 Medium-High |

## 🔍 Code Review Process

### Data Migration and Schema Change Process

**⚠️ Important Principle: Plan ahead, communicate fully**

When launching new features involving data fixes or Schema migration, discuss feasibility and subsequent implementation timing with development lead and operations lead as early as possible.

#### Why Early Communication?

Data migration and Schema changes are high-risk operations that may affect:

- **Data integrity**: Data structure changes may cause data loss or corruption
- **Service availability**: Large-scale data migration may affect service performance
- **Rollback complexity**: Rollback after Schema changes is often more complex than code rollback
- **Time window**: Need sufficient time for data migration and verification
- **Multi-team collaboration**: Involves development, testing, operations multiple teams

#### Common Scenario Examples

| Scenario | Early Communication Time | Key Discussion Points |
|----------|-------------------------|----------------------|
| **Add new field** | Early development (1-2 weeks) | Default value strategy, index creation, whether to backfill historical data |
| **Field type change** | Design phase (2-3 weeks) | Data conversion rules, incompatible data handling, rollback plan |
| **Large-scale data fix** | Design phase (2-4 weeks) | Data volume estimation, migration duration, batch strategy, downtime plan |
| **Index rebuild** | Design phase (1-2 weeks) | Performance impact, execution time window, online/offline approach |
| **Data archiving/cleanup** | Design phase (2-3 weeks) | Archiving strategy, data backup, recovery mechanism |

### Code Review Flow

#### Submitter Recommendations

1. **Create Merge Request**
   - Fill in clear title and description
   - Explain change reasons and impact scope
   - Link related Issues or requirements

2. **Self-check list**
   - [ ] Code passes pre-commit checks
   - [ ] Related unit tests added/updated
   - [ ] Documentation updated (if necessary)
   - [ ] No obvious performance issues
   - [ ] No security risks

**Note**: Project has Code Owner mechanism configured, reviewers will be auto-assigned based on changed files, no need to manually specify.

#### Reviewer Work

1. **Code quality review**
   - Code logic correctness
   - Code readability and maintainability
   - Whether follows project standards

2. **Risk assessment**
   - Data security risks (especially for data scripts)
   - Performance impact (async code, database queries)
   - Compatibility issues (dependency upgrades, API changes)

3. **Review feedback**
   - Provide clear modification suggestions
   - Mark severity (Must Fix / Should Fix / Nice to Have)
   - Respond promptly (try within 24 hours)
